pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty

this that pretty-girl mantra, this that flaunt you
just touched down in l.a.
pretty girls don't do drama, 'less we wanna
it'll be depending on the day
pretty girls packed in a defender, know i'ma defend her
never let her catch no stray
this that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna
make you wanna swing both ways

mix me with the drama (drama)
check you like commas (ah)
my clothes are pajamas ('jamas)
straight from the cold plunge (hey) (ah)
daytime baddie use her mind
quick switch of the fit for the night (night)
swerving through the lane, we'll be twenty-minute-late
'cause we had to do an in-n-out drive-by

it's not that deep (deep), i'm not that drunk (drunk)
sometimes girls just gotta have fun
throw it back, all that ass
me and my sis, way too attached
it's not that deep (deep), we're not that dumb (dumb)
look at them bonnies on the run
inside glowing like the sun (sun, s-)
you gonna feel us every day (day)
